# myFlix
Created with Angular, this is the client-side of a full-stack web app, allowing users to make requests to and receive responses from the server-side.

## Overview:
This project is a full-stack web app providing access to a database of movies, including descriptions, plus director and genre information. Users can create an account, sign-in and add or remove movies from a list of their favourites.

## Context:
As part of CareerFoundry's full-stack programme, the goal of this project was to learn the refactor the client-side of the app from React to Angular technologies and tools and to progress my JavaScript development skills.
